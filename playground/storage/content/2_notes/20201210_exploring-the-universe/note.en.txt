A small river named Duden flows by <strong>their</strong> place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.</p>"},"id":"f5d8b236-9ec4-4a17-b3f2-1d6589c4e0a3","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["file://BYXR0pvumEbfTknP"],"src":"","alt":"Staring at stars","caption":"Staring at stars","link":"","ratio":"16/9","crop":"true"},"id":"c4e9d2f1-7b5a-48c3-95e6-2f8d1a3b6c0e","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p><strong>The Big Oxmox</strong> advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen.

When she reached the first hills of the Italic <a href=\"https://getkirby.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mountains</a>, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy.</p>"},"id":"b8a2e6d4-5f9c-4d1b-8e7a-3c2f9d6b5a4f","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana","citation":"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Oettinger\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Anthony Oettinger</a>"},"id":"d1c7b3a9-2e8f-4d5c-9a6b-7f4e3d2c1b8a","isHidden":false,"type":"quote"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Let's put a heading here"},"id":"e9f2a5b8-1d7c-4e3b-8f6a-2c5d9e4b3a7f","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>But nothing the <u>copy</u> said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their <em>projects</em> again and again.
